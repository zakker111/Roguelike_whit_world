# smoketest/scenarios

Scenario steps split by domain. Each module exports functions consumed by the orchestrator (runner.js).

Files
- world.js — routing to dungeon/town, world tile scans.
- dungeon.js — enter dungeon from overworld; basic verification.
- dungeon_persistence.js — chest loot, exit/re‑enter persistence, non‑stair guard.
- town.js — town entry and basic interactions from overworld.
- town_flows.js — NPC bump, home routes, props, late‑night checks.
- town_diagnostics.js — shops, schedules, bump‑buy, gold operations, shop UI.
- inventory.js — open/close behavior, equip/unequip flows, potions, two‑handed and hand chooser tests.
- combat.js — spawn enemies, routing and bump‑attacks, decay snapshot.
- overlays.js — grid/town overlays toggles and perf checks.
- determinism.js — seed re‑apply and anchor checks (nearest town/dungeon).

Notes
- The orchestrator runs scenarios in a pipeline by default; you can filter with `&scenarios=world,dungeon,combat` (or legacy `&smoke=`).
- Scenario context (`ctx`) includes: key(), sleep(), makeBudget(), ensureAllModalsClosed(), CONFIG, caps, record(), recordSkip().
