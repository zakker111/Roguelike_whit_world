    "howToUse": [
      "Each key under this object is a tower theme id, e.g. 'bandit_tower'.",
      "towers.json.types[...].themeId should reference one of these ids.",
      "Enemies listed under 'enemies' are used as the main spawn pool for that tower type.",
      "Bosses listed under 'bosses' are candidates for the dedicated top-floor boss, unless towers.json.types[...].boss.typeId explicitly overrides it.",
      "lootBias can be used to bias chest tiers or item categories for that tower type; it is optional and advisory."
    ],
    "howToAddTheme": [
      "1) Add a new top-level key (e.g., 'undead_tower').",
      "2) Under that key, define an 'enemies' array with { id, weight } entries. 'id' must match an enemy id in data/entities/enemies.json.",
      "3) (Optional) Define a 'bosses' array with { id, weight } entries for boss candidates.",
      "4) (Optional) Define 'lootBias' with whatever fields your loot system understands (tiers, weaponTypes, tags).",
      "5) Reference this theme from towers.json via types[...].themeId."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "The runtime currently still has hard-coded bandit tower behavior; theme data is introduced first for configuration and future use.",
      "When theme-driven spawning is wired in, the code will read these weights but will keep hard-coded fallbacks if data is missing.",
      "Weights are relative; only their ratios matter (e.g., 5/3/1)."
