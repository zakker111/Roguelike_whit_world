# BUGS

- npc are not going in inns bed or upstairs of inn (investigate stairs congestion, upstairs routing, bed‑adjacent tile availability)
- some times in towns some extra signs and fire places inside walls
- some npc dont sleep in theid beds
- some work needed for smoketestrunner
- multirun in smoketest skips first multirun 
- itseems eguibed items go to inventory when re going to dungeon/town &lt;-very fy this
- creatures don't spawn reliably in Region Map (wildlife) — verify GameData.animals loaded, spawn gating/probabilities, and per‑tile cleared state
- creatures spawn sometetimes too often atleast in fotest and same place when entering regional map they dont move but they do flee 
- Vild seppo S does not have inventory in encounter
- in dungeons when enemies fight each other they are logged(wich is good for now for debugging purpoces) but they give player xp when they kill each other
- some bloodstanes seem to be generated from ruins/animal(creatures)/encounters in another regional map
- in dungeons enemies seems to show behind walls(not line of sight)
- in encounters ui says in left counter all creatures something it should not say anything in ruins or encounters
- VERIFY this happens Dungeon markers color-coded by level on main map and minimap: green (1–2), amber (3), red (4–5). 
- i dont see what killed enemy in ruins chek encounters too
- there is something wierd when creature spawns same map in region_map and so one some blood stanes are followed by next region map from ruins or animals(creatures) creatures dont move in map when spawning them
- minimap shows all chunks when going in ruins, dungeons, towns etc and re entering
- minimap shows dungeons and towns
- dungeons sometimes carry over some wierd stuff like camp fires and some other shit from encounters 
- Make coherent way out like in ruins and region_map encounters there is only &gt; and not clearly visible ab coherent
- caravan master does not seem to spawn in towns cities etc. when caravan enters it
- caravans in towns need verification: prefab caravan stalls/shops vs actual parked caravans and town presence behavior
