# BUGS

- npc are not going in inns bed or upstairs of inn (investigate stairs congestion, upstairs routing, bed‑adjacent tile availability)
- some times in towns some extra signs and fire places inside walls
- some npc dont sleep in theid beds
- some work needed for smoketestrunner
- multirun in smoketest skips first multirun 
- creatures don't spawn reliably in Region Map (wildlife) — verify GameData.animals loaded, spawn gating/probabilities, and per‑tile cleared state
- creatures spawn sometetimes too often atleast in fotest and same place when entering regional map they dont move but they do flee 
- [FIXED] in dungeons when enemies fight each other they are logged (which is good for debugging purposes), but they gave player XP when they killed each other
- in dungeons enemies seems to show behind walls(not line of sight)
- in encounters ui says in left counter all creatures something it should not say anything in ruins or encounters
- VERIFY this happens Dungeon markers color-coded by level on main map and minimap: green (1–2), amber (3), red (4–5). 
- there is something wierd when creature spawns same map in region_map and so one some blood stanes are followed by next region map from ruins or animals(creatures) creatures dont move in map when spawning them
- minimap shows all chunks when going in ruins, dungeons, towns etc and re entering
- minimap shows dungeons and towns
- dungeons sometimes carry over some wierd stuff like camp fires and some other shit from encounters 
- caravan master does not seem to spawn in towns cities etc. when caravan enters it
- caravans in towns need verification: prefab caravan stalls/shops vs actual parked caravans and town presence behavior
- dungeon mountain passes (dungeons biased to spawn near mountain edges) don’t seem to spawn in practice; investigate terrain bias and anchor selection in world/infinite_gen.js and world/world.js
- mountain-pass dungeons (A/B linked pair) are currently unreliable: interior portal + normal exit behavior does not consistently send the player to the intended far-side overworld tile; treat mountain-pass dungeon travel as broken for now
- world generation / infinite overworld gets slow and sluggish after exploring large chunks of the world; investigate performance of infinite_gen + world_runtime expansion and caching when many chunks have been visited
- sometimes the player can trade with a shopkeeper even when they are not at their shop (e.g., bumping them away from the shop door still opens the shop UI)
- in some towns, ground/terrain tinting still changes incorrectly or inconsistently (tiles changing biome color unexpectedly)
- animals/creatures on the Region Map sometimes use odd or incorrect glyphs (verify animal glyph mapping in region map overlays)
- [FIXED] Seppo's True Blade (and other two-handed hand weapons that occupy both hands) previously counted Attack twice for followers when the same item was equipped in left and right; Attack/Defense aggregation for both players and followers now counts each equipped item only once so two-handed weapons behave as a single blade instead of double-stacking damage
