Tiny Roguelike — README

What this is
- A small browser-based roguelike with a data-driven content model (items, enemies, NPCs, shops, town layout).
- Deterministic seeds for repeatable runs, simple UI, single-floor dungeons, and a built-in smoketest runner.

Play it
- Open index.html in a browser (or the deployed URL).
- Controls:
  - Move: Arrow keys or Numpad
  - Action (G): interact, loot, enter/exit
  - Local Region Map: G (open local overlay on walkable overworld tiles; M is disabled)
  - Inventory: I
  - GOD panel: P
  - Help: F1 (or Help button in the HUD)
  - Wait: Numpad5
  - Brace: B (dungeon only; raises block chance this turn if holding a defensive hand item)

Overworld and exploration (infinite world)
- Infinite, deterministic overworld streaming in 32-tile chunks as you explore beyond the current edges.
- Real FOV/LOS on the overworld: only tiles you’ve seen are revealed; unseen tiles are fogged.
- Minimap reflects fog-of-war and grows as the map expands. Toggle in the GOD panel (persists).
- Roads and bridges:
  - Roads connect nearby towns within the currently streamed window (no dangling roads off-screen).
  - Bridges carve fully across river width (1–3 tiles) for complete crossings.
- POIs (towns/dungeons) are placed sparsely and deterministically; density slightly increased (~1–2%).
- Mountain pass dungeons:
  - If a dungeon entrance is on/adjacent to a Mountain tile, a special portal is placed deeper inside.
  - Stepping on that portal tunnels to a new dungeon “across” the mountain.
  - Any regular STAIRS tile returns you to the overworld (press G).

Encounters
- While traveling on the overworld, you may be prompted with a random encounter. Accept to enter a small tactical map themed by the current biome.
- Default encounter rate is 5% (tunable via the GOD panel “Encounter rate” slider; persists).
- Exit: stand on the '>' tile and press G to return to the overworld (no auto-exit).
- Props: pressing G while standing on a prop logs a context message (barrel/crate/bench/campfire, etc.). Lootable containers (chests/corpses) use G to open loot.
- Merchants: some encounters feature a wandering merchant. Bumping into the merchant opens the Shop UI; premium stock is available.

Towns and Wild Seppo
- Shops, schedules, plaza, greeters; bump-shop at the door to trade when open.
- Shop types include: Inn (always), Blacksmith, Armorer, Apothecary, Trader, Carpenter, Bakery (06:00–15:00).
  - Shop presence is probabilistic by town size; at most one of each type per town/city (deduplicated).
- Residents who like the Inn will sometimes stop by the Inn in the early evening before going home (~33% of days), with short sits and seating cap to avoid crowding.
- Wild Seppo (wandering merchant) may arrive at the plaza rarely during day/dusk.
  - Only one Seppo can be in town at a time; no duplicates will spawn.

Region Map (local tactical overlay)
- Open with G on a walkable overworld tile (or on RUINS tiles); M key is disabled.
- Looting: pressing G on a corpse or chest opens the loot panel (like in dungeons); dead animals show exactly what you looted via the panel.
- Neutral animals (deer/fox/boar) are rare:
  - At most one spawns in sufficiently wild areas; many tiles have none.
  - If animals were seen here previously, future visits re‑spawn only with a low chance (seeded).
  - Clearing animals marks the tile as cleared; future spawns are skipped.

Data-driven configuration
- Combined assets (strict): data/world_assets.json contains tiles and props and is required in strict mode.
  - tiles: structural and terrain entries (e.g., FLOOR, WALL, DOOR, STAIRS, WINDOW).
  - props: furniture/decor entries (e.g., lamp, bench, chest) with unified fields:
    - glyph, colors.fg
    - properties: walkable, blocksFOV, emitsLight
    - appearsIn, tags
    - light: castRadius, glowTiles, color (optional)
- Other JSON registries under data/:
  - items.json, enemies.json, npcs.json, consumables.json, shops.json, town.json
- Loader: data/loader.js loads and exposes GameData.*; logs a warning if world_assets.json is missing/invalid; tiles/props are not loaded in strict mode without it.
- file://: you can still open index.html directly; minimal defaults keep the game playable, but tiles/props require the combined assets file for full visuals.

Determinism and seeds
- RNG is centralized; apply seeds in the GOD panel (persisted to localStorage as SEED).
- With the same seed and context, generation and item rolls are repeatable.

Smoketest (optional)
- Orchestrator default: append ?smoketest=1 to the URL; add &dev=1 for diagnostics.
- Scenario filter: &scenarios=world,dungeon,inventory,combat,town,overlays,determinism (legacy style &smoke= also supported).
- Multiple runs: &smokecount=N.
- Legacy thin shim: &legacy=1 (orchestrator skips auto‑run; shim delegates to orchestrator).
- The GOD panel shows:
  - Step Details (OK/FAIL/SKIP)
  - Key Checklist (entered dungeon, chest/persistence, enemy spawn/types/glyphs, town/NPC/shop checks)
  - Full JSON report with download buttons (JSON/TXT)

Local dev server
- To serve JSON reliably (instead of file://), use the included static server:
  - node server.js
  - Open http://localhost:8080/?dev=1
- You can change the port with PORT=9000 node server.js

Bundling (optional, Vite)
- This project supports optional bundling for production using Vite. Native ESM still works without bundling.
- Setup:
  - npm install
  - npm run dev         # start Vite dev server (imports are resolved automatically)
  - npm run build       # builds to dist/ with optimized assets
  - npm run preview     # serves the built dist/ on http://localhost:8080
- Deploy:
  - You can deploy either the raw repo (native ESM) or the dist/ folder produced by Vite.

Key features at a glance
- Infinite, deterministic overworld with chunk streaming and fog-of-war.
- Single-floor dungeons with connected rooms, guaranteed stairs, and data-driven enemies.
- Interaction-first gameplay: bump-to-attack, G to loot/interact/enter/exit.
- HUD perf overlay: shows last turn and draw timings (ms) next to the clock for optimization visibility.
- Inventory/equipment:
  - Two-handed items occupy both hands; unequipping one removes both.
  - One-handed items auto-equip to the empty hand or can be equipped explicitly left/right.
  - Decay increases through combat; breakage is supported.
- Towns with shops and NPCs; Seppo spawns at most once at a time.
- Lighting from props:
  - Town: lamps and fireplaces emit light at night/dawn/dusk; small warm glow overlay.
  - Dungeon: wall torches spawn sparsely on walls, always emit light; subtle glow overlay.
- UI/UX:
  - FOV and LOS consistent; seen tiles dim when not visible.
  - Escape closes modals; movement is ignored while any modal is open.

Useful flags and persistence
- dev=1: enable DEV mode (extra logs); dev=0 disables.
- mirror=1|0: side log mirror on/off (persists in localStorage).
- Seed persists in localStorage SEED and is shown in the GOD panel.

Cleanup and pre‑merge checklist (Phase 5)
- Duplicate/dead code policy:
  - Prefer ctx.* handles over window.*; facades centralize UI (UIBridge) and mode lifecycles (WorldRuntime/TownRuntime/DungeonRuntime).
  - Draw scheduling is centralized; individual modules avoid requestDraw, relying on orchestrator paths.
  - Inventory rendering occurs only when the panel is open; DOM work is coalesced across actions.
- How to generate the duplication/size report:
  - node scripts/analyze.js
  - Output written to analysis/phase1_report.md (top 20 largest files and approximate duplicated 3‑line shingles across JS).
- Recommended pre‑merge steps:
  - Run lint and formatter (see above).
  - Regenerate analysis/phase1_report.md and skim duplicates for potential DRY refactors.
  - Run smoketest (?smoketest=1) and confirm 0 FAIL steps; small SKIPs are acceptable.
  - Verify GOD toggles for Grid/Perf/Minimap and debug overlays behave as expected.
- Known cleanup outcomes from Phase 5:
  - Removed redundant requestDraw calls in Actions/Town/GOD/UI; draw orchestration consolidated.
  - Removed direct ShopUI/DOM fallbacks in core; UIBridge is the single UI path.
  - World-mode FOV recompute guard avoids re-filling arrays on movement.
  - Renderer hot paths cache base layers and glyph lookups; minimap uses an offscreen cache and responsive sizing.

Notes
- Prefer ctx.* over window.* in modules.
- Use UIBridge (core/ui_bridge.js) for UI interactions (inventory, loot, game over, confirm, town exit button) instead of calling window.UI directly.
- Dungeon/town lifecycles are centralized via DungeonRuntime and TownRuntime; Modes delegates transitions and persistence through these facades.
- UI panels are ESC-to-close; input prioritizes closing modals before movement.

Troubleshooting
- Infinite world generator required: the game expects InfiniteGen to be available. If missing or not initialized, startup will log an error and fail. Use the included server (node server.js) or Vite dev server to ensure modules and JSON assets load.
- Seeds: configure via the GOD panel (“Apply Seed” / “Reroll Seed”). The current seed is shown and persists to localStorage (SEED) for deterministic runs.
- Modal gating: movement and actions are blocked while a modal is open (Inventory, Loot, GOD, Shop, Smoke, Help, Region Map, Confirm). Press Escape to close the top-most modal; Confirm dialogs block all keys except Escape.
