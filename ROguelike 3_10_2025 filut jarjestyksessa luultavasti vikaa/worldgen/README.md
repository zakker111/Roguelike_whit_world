World and town generation scripts to move here:

Prefabs module API (stamp/trySlip)
- The prefabs module provides helpers to place buildings and shops as prefabs.

Return shape:
- stampPrefab(ctx, prefab, bx, by, buildings)
- trySlipStamp(ctx, prefab, bx, by, maxSlip = 2, buildings)
Both return an object:
  { ok: boolean, rect: { x, y, w, h }, shop?: { type, name, door: { x, y }, scheduleOverride?, signWanted? } }

Notes:
- ok indicates placement success. Callers should check res && res.ok.
- rect is the placed building rectangle for bookkeeping (e.g., dedup, windows, props).
- shop is present only when the prefab declares a shop; it includes door position and optional schedule/sign metadata.
- Older code paths used boolean returns; if you migrate any callers, do not assume boolean â€” inspect res.ok and properties instead.
